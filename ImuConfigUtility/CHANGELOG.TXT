Config Utility Version 1.0.0
Device Firmware Version 1.5
------------------------------------------

- device supports a wide range of accelerometers and gyroscopes
- implements smoothing filtering algorithm 
- implements algorithm for combining gyroscope and accelerometer data
- HID USB interface makes the device compatible virtually with all modern operating systems (Mac,Windows,Linux)
- configuration utility (for Windows only for now)
- adjustable smoothing and scale factor for outputs
- configurable sensibility for accelerometer and gyroscope (can be set per axis)
- configurable midpoint (0g voltage) for accelerometer (can be set per axis)
- auto-find gyroscope midpoint (0 deg/s voltage)
- you can use separate accelerometer/gyroscopes for different axis
- Z axis not implemented in this release
- configurable analog input ports AN0-AN5 for each axis (please note 18F2550 does not have AN5 input , but 18F4550 does)
- ability to invert axis
- capture output and raw adc data into a comma separated values file (.csv)
- charting feature of all inputs/outputs 
- graphical display of output and buttons
- supports up to 8 buttons
- configuration is stored in device EEPROM
- it is possible to use accelerometer alone on any axis (1, 2 or 3-axis) in this case set Smoothing to 0-10 value
- it is possible to gyro alone on any axis (1,2 or 3 axis) in this case set Smoothing to 100-255 , please note that the output will snap to middle after a while since gyro only provides rate information
- it is possible to use to use gyro and accelerometer on any axis (RECOMMENDED) in this case set smoothing to 20-100 value
- you can use multiple accelerometers or gyroscopes
- you can orient gyro or accelerometer as you like (but aligned to 90 degrees increments)
- you can connect your gyro and accelerometer outputs to any of the AN0-AN4 ports (for PIC18F2550).
